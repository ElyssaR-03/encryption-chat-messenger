## Summary

In the face of modern digital communication vulnerabilities, our project aims to safeguard messages using end-to-end encryption. By implementing symmetric, asymmetric, and hybrid encryption methods, we aim to analyze the trade-offs between security and computational efficiency. Our ultimate goal is to develop a chat messaging system with optimized end-to-end encryption that maintains the integrity and privacy of digital communications.

## Introduction

Leveraging the concepts learned in our coursework, this project introduces basic chat functionalities augmented with a critical security feature: end-to-end encryption. We aim to ensure secure communication between a server and a client by encrypting messages on the server side before transmission. The client, upon receiving these messages, will decrypt them to display the secured content. We have chosen to implement this feature to underline the significance of robust data security in message transmission and reception, thereby preventing unauthorized access.

## Technical Details

### Encryption Algorithms

We employ various encryption algorithms such as RSA, MD5, SHA-256, and AES. Each algorithm brings its own balance of security and performance, and through this project, we aim to compare these aspects to determine the most efficient approach for real-time communication.

### Implementation

Messages are encrypted on the server side using a chosen encryption algorithm. The encrypted message is then sent through the network to the client, which uses a corresponding decryption algorithm to interpret and display the message.

## Installation and Usage

_To be completed with specific instructions on setting up and running the chat messaging system._
